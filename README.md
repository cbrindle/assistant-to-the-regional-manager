# YouDo

### Introduction

Please don't name this project "YouDo". That is a bad, bad name.

Instead, you're going to name it whatever you want (I *guess* even "YouDo"), and make it yours in many other ways as well!


### How To Make YouDo Yours

You should pick:

1. What features your app has. Feel free to take features away that don't match your vision! For additional features, some ideas are below, but you are also required to add a feature of your own!
2. What the layout should be. *At least* two layouts, with each layout requiring a wireframe approved by a member of the instructional staff.
3. Your visual theme. Go ahead, dive into the css. Just don't leave it so plain!


### Feature Ideas

1. A button to delete all items, regardless of whether they're complete or not.
2. A per-todo button to delete, possibly appearing on hover.
3. A button to sort by date added or priority.
4. Add either a hover style to see which one you're currently looking at or an every-other-todo style to make scanning horizontally easier.
5. Add toggling from done back.
6. Add the ability to set a due date. This will likely require adding to the html.
   * Add the ability to see what's overdue.
   * Add the ability to sort by due date.
  

### Once you're done, let's deploy it!

Use surge. It's cool.
