# Assistant to the Regional Manager

### Introduction
This is my first kinda-sorta-actual app that I was able to create after 14 weeks at Code Immersives Web Development program in NYC. This is a simple day planner app that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript... all with NO BOOTSTRAP! It still has a little ways to go as it has no backend, but it's getting there.


### Features:
- Add an item to a respective list by typing it into it's corresponding input box and clicking ADD.
- Mark an item complete by clicking on it. The stylization will change.
- Want to undo marking an item as complete? Simply click it again to change it back to normal.
- A Remove Completed button will remove all items marked as complete from their respective lists.
- The schedule area has edge case catching that does not allow the end time of an event to come before the start time.
- Edge casing of preventing empty values being added to a list has also been implemented.
- The app is fully responsive to a desktop, tablet, and mobile view.
- Also... NO BOOTSTRAP!
